= Installing on Mac =
The best way to install it on Mac is:

Install the package manager "Homebrew" for Mac using http://brew.sh/ <br />
Install csshX using brew using "brew install csshx" (and follow the suggestions) <br />
Set "/opt/local/bin/bash" as standard shell in the Terminal.app (Type  "/opt/local/bin/bash" into the current shell -> go to "Shell -> Use as standard", Close and Open Terminal) <br />

Now everything should be ready

== Example ==
csshX --ssh_args="-i /Users/cbinnig/Workspace/XDB/doomdb.pem" -l ec2-user 54.185.38.252 54.188.69.251 

Important is that you have to use an absoluta path to the pem file and the pem file should only be accessible for your user (i.e., execute "chmod 600 /Users/cbinnig/Workspace/XDB/doomdb.pem").

After executing the example cmd above as many terminals open as hosts specified!
